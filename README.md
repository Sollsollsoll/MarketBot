# MarketBot
Ever wanted to trade stocks programmatically?  Here at MarketBot, we plan on creating a tool to analyze the equities market and execute orders via code.  Our vision is to learn about technical indicators and attempt to employ them in the creation of a profitable, automated trader.

Initialize your configuration with the following in MarketBot/settings.json

{
    "config": {
        "requests_interval_millis": "",
        "alpaca_key_id": "",
        "alpaca_private_key": ""
    }
}
